            Except for the main duty, like learning and coding in React, Ruby on Rails and Graphql Ruby, \
            co-working with our team members is one of my favorite things, especially when we finally figure out a way to solve a problem. \
            No matter what the problem is, the main thing is all about to let the team can keep running fast. \
            Refactor the whole system structure is another big thing for me. Have the discussion with our DevOp teammate and implement the solution to see our system get optimized makes me feel excited. \
            During my time in the Codegiant, I also took around 2 months to handle another platform call Talentherder. \
            In that project, what impressed me the most is data migration process. To integrate Database from SQLite & MongoDB to PostgreSQL with Python Jupyter Lib is an interesting challenge!"
